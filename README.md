Thanks for downloading More dspObjects
======================================

More dspObjects is a plugin for Mura CMS that simply contains a few display objects that aren't included with Mura.

Calendar Jump
-------------
A form that takes in a month and year and jumps to that date on a calendar page.  The form automatically builds the list of years by using the past three years and the next three years.  The month is the current selected month of the calendar.

Currently the display object only has support for calendars.  In the future (if I receive any requests for it) I will add support for portals as well.

Search Section
--------------
A search form that will search within the current section (current page and all sub pages).  The form displays the menu title of the page so that the user knows where they are searching.

Page Tools
----------
Gives a couple options available in the User Tools display object for non-logged in users.
* Print This Page - Allows a user to print the current page
* Email This Page - Emails a copy of a link to submitted emails

Licensing
---------
Licensing can be found in LICENSE.txt
